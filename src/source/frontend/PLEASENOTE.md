Excluding the included modified `lib` code, the vast majority of that found within this directory and its descendants should never see the light of day in any serious production environment. It was hastily, and, at that, slopily coded to fit the specific closed use case for which it was designed. This is nothing more than a demo of the libraryâ€”far out-of-scope of this project's goal, and therefore given much less care and attention than the actual objective. 
TL;DR: use this code at a great risk to the performance and stability of your frontend. Unlike `lib`, it was not intended to be an actual viable product, and should not be treated as such.
